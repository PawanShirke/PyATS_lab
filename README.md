pyats labs and learning


I am refering the installation of pyats on my mac from https://pubhub.devnetcloud.com/media/pyats-getting-started/docs/install/installpyATS.html

To test the installation, from the current (pyATS) directory, clone the Git examples repository:
git clone https://github.com/CiscoTestAutomation/examples

This repos has the all that is required for testing the pyats,

I am adding my mock file with all the test case that I will doing
